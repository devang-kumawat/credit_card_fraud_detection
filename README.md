## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry. Detecting fraudulent transactions accurately is crucial to prevent financial losses and protect users' sensitive information. This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to build a fraud detection model.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook [credit-card-fraud-detect-under-over-sampling.ipynb](https://github.com/devang-kumawat/credit_card_fraud_detection/blob/main/credit-card-fraud-detect-under-over-sampling.ipynb) demonstrates the following steps:
- Data loading and exploration.
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution.
- Implementing under-sampling and over-sampling techniques to balance the dataset.
- Building and training a machine learning model for fraud detection.
- Model evaluation using various metrics.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository but can be obtained from [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). The dataset contains features obtained from PCA transformations due to privacy concerns.

## Features

The notebook demonstrates feature engineering and scaling techniques to prepare the dataset for modeling. Exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the distribution and relationships between features.

## Under-sampling and Over-sampling

The notebook explores both under-sampling (reducing the number of instances of the majority class) and over-sampling (increasing the number of instances of the minority class) techniques to address class imbalance in the dataset.

## Modeling

A machine learning model is trained using the preprocessed data. The notebook demonstrates how to split the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.

## Results

The notebook provides insights into the effectiveness of under-sampling and over-sampling techniques in improving the model's ability to detect credit card fraud. Results and conclusions drawn from the experiment are presented in the notebook.
